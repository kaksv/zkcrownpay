# zKPayme

ZKPayme is a crown faucet intended to Drip crown tokens(or another ERC 20) token to a wallet while paying gas using the same Token.
This will ensure that as long as one owns crown tokens, they dont need any other Tokens to carry out any tasks with our Faucet.

### Roadmap

-Paymaster front end and  Logic to eexecute the given transaction model(Progress)
